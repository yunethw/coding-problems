# Coding Problems and Solutions

I built this repo to keep practicing coding problems and logic. Please share your thoughts on better solutions for any problem :sparkles:


## :dart: [longest nonrepetitive substring](longest_nonrepetitive_substring.py)

*When given a string, finds longest substring without repeating characters*
```python
>>> longest_nonrepetitive_substring('tzmfrlssjydyysdxiidw')
tzmfrls 7
```

## :dart: [longest palindrome](longest_palindrome.py)

*When given a string, s, find the longest palindromic substring in s*
```python
>>> longest_palindrome('kayaking')
kayak
```
